# Generative-AI-MNIST-Digits-Generation-Using-GANs
MNIST synthetic digits generation using simple GAN architecture

Our project ventures into this fascinating realm by harnessing the power of GANs to tackle the iconic MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. Through meticulous training, our network learns to generate virtual representations of these digits, mimicking their characteristics with increasing fidelity. As the Generator refines its abilities to produce convincing facsimiles, the Discriminator sharpens its discernment to differentiate between real and synthetic images. This collaborative effort results in the creation of remarkable synthetic digit renditions, showcasing the potential of GANs in generating lifelike visual content.
